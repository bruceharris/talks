  ## How is [Meteor](http://www.meteor.com) different?
  ## Case studies

  * Code and deploy toy chat app in 5 minutes

  * [Esteamator](https://github.com/bruceharris/esteamator) - agile estimation tool for distributed teams


  ## Applicable use cases

  * Present

  * Future outlook

  ## My experience with Meteor:

  * Need for estimation tool for distributed team

  * Built Esteamator with Meteor

## Composing the tech stack

> ### Lots of frameworks/libraries/tools out there
> ### Need to choose tech for each layer in stack
> ### Compose and integrate
> ### Tools and process to build/deploy

## Composing the tech stack

> ### lots of tedious effort just to get project set up

---
## Composing the tech stack

> ### Explored Meteor among other frameworks
> ### Meteor is a *full stack* framework
> ### ... with a native build tool
> ### ... and deploy/hosting service

.left-column[
  ## How is it different?
  ### - Full stack framework
]

.right-column[

  ### Stack is already integrated

  * Eliminates overhead of project setup

  * One language (JavaScript)

  * Package system with sensible defaults


  ### Deployment and hosting support

  * Short cycle from scratch to fully functional prototype

.left-column[
  ## How is it different?
  ### - Full stack framework
  ### - Realtime
]
.right-column[

  ### The internet of the future - no more stale client

  * Seamless client/server integration

  * Local cache of DB - server pushes deltas to client

  * Same database API on client and server

  * Abstracts distinction between client/server

  * Less latency - *synchronous* local DB access

  * Callbacks not always needed

  ## How is it different?
  ### - Full stack framework
  ### - Realtime
  ### - Reactivity

.right-column[
  ### Reactive templates

  * Automatically update in response to DB changes

  * No need to subscribe views to models

  * Views *always* reflect data

  * DOM manipulation not necessary

.left-column[
  ## In Conclusion
  ### Considerations
]
.right-column[

  ## Possible Downsides

  * Lots of magic - edge cases not handled by magic?

  * Unit testing for trivial units?

  * No REST - can't expose API to other clients?

  * Performance / network / battery concerns on mobile?

  * Lacks full integration with NPM - separate package system

  * Client side rendering only

  * Not yet proven with large applications

  * Young evolving framework with breaking API changes

  ## In Conclusion
  ### Considerations
  ### Room for improvement
]
.right-column[

  ## Need to be addressed before 1.0

  * Poor built-in namespace / scope / dependency management

  * No namespacing for templates

  * Scalability - multiple node deployment not supported yet

  * No server side routing yet
]

  ## In Conclusion
  ### Considerations
  ### Room for improvement
  ### Use Cases
]
.right-column[
  ## Not a good fit for...

  * Lots of data needed on client

  * Very frequent "noisy" data updates

  * Lacking maturity for industries that require proven platforms
]

.left-column[
  ## In Conclusion
  ### Considerations
  ### Room for improvement
  ### Use Cases
]
.right-column[

  ## Likely good fit for...

  * Small to medium size applications

  * Prototypes to be discarded and rebuilt

  * Non mission critical applications

  * Timeline / minimizing dev effort is a priority
]

template: inverseLeft

## Outlook

* MVP approach - ship early and imperfect

* Lot$ of funding from top tier VC firms

* Large active community

* Many known issues to be addressed by 1.0

* Ground breaking ideas will inspire other frameworks
